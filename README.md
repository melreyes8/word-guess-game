### Hangman - a Word Guessing Game 

This word guessing game is set with a movie style theme.  

### How to Play

1. As the player opens the page, he/she is will see the statement to press any key to start the game.

2. The player will see the displayed number of underscore characters, which represent each letter in a one-word movie title that is to be guessed.

3. As the player presses a letter key and it matches a letter in the word, that letter will replace the corresponding underscore. Otherwise, if 
there's not a match, this letter will be displayed in the "Letters Already Guessed" box, and the count in the "Number of Guesses Remaining" goes down by 1 count. (The player has 10 chances to press a matching letter.)

4. WIN: If the player successfully pressed all the letter keys matching the word, the "Win" count goes up, and a new word to be guessed is displayed, "Number of Guesses Remaining" returns to 10, and clears any letters in the "Letters Already Guessed" box.

5. LOSS: If the player's pressed letter keys did not match the word, and exhausted the 10 chances, the "Losses" count goes up, and a new word to be guessed is displayed, "Number of Guesses Remaining" returns to 10, and clears any letters in the "Letters Already Guessed" box.

### Additional Information

This game is currently not coded to limit the win counter; thus, the game is set on continuous loop until the player decides to stop playing the game (the game starts and resets continuously based on the player's actions). At this time, there are only 8 one-word movie titles to be guessed for this game, so it will get boring at some point. Furthermore, this game is supposed to display the movie-trailer when the word is guessed successfully; however, these codes are still in work.
